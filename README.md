# UFOs

# Overview
In this project, I am creating a webpage that has allows users to view information about UFO sightings in different american cities. The purpose of this project is to allow users to filter various ufo sightings in the area by date, location and the UFO 'shape'. 

# Resources
- software: Visual Studio Code
- Languages: HTML, Javascript (JS6), CSS.

# Results
In my project I was able to successfully create a webpage containing UFO data. This was done by using existing javascript data containing the sightings, and creating a javascript query that allows the sightings to be added to the HTML document. After merging the queries, I was able to create a website containing the possible UFO sightings. An example can be seen [here]. To perform a search, the user just has to complete the fields to the left containing the data. The results will automatically populate. One drawback from my project is that I included a "filter table" button which does not actually work. This button is meant to carry out the filter function but the webpage automatically filters as you add the information. That is one thing I would need to modify.
